# Swarm mode

Docker Engine 1.12 introduces swarm mode that enables you to create a cluster of one or more Docker Engines called a swarm. A swarm consists of one or more nodes: physical or virtual machines running Docker Engine 1.12 or later in swarm mode.

### Manager nodes
Manager nodes handle cluster management tasks:

- maintaining cluster state
- scheduling services
- serving swarm mode HTTP API endpoints

### Worker nodes
Worker nodes are also instances of Docker Engine whose sole purpose is to execute containers. Worker nodes donâ€™t participate in the Raft distributed state, make scheduling decisions, or serve the swarm mode HTTP API.

You can create a swarm of one manager node, but you cannot have a worker node without at least one manager node. By default, all managers are also workers. In a single manager node cluster, you can run commands like docker service create and the scheduler will place all tasks on the local Engine.

## Creating swarm

Create one network for docker images to reside in:
```
  docker network create -d overlay preferredNetworkName
```

Then create instances of your docker containers:
```
docker service create -p 8080:80 --replicas 2 --network preferredNetworkName --name assignedName creatorName/imageName
```

If need to assign another amount of replicas - instances of containers, then do
```
docker service update --replicas=4 assignedName
```
